I used a template to create my portfolio!! The main file is index.html, and the index.css file 
has the info about the alignment, buttons, etc. for my portfolio page. If you want to find the
template, click the white button that says "Star" at the very bottom of my portfolio page. 
I just copied over the files into my own github repository and then edited them to my liking.
